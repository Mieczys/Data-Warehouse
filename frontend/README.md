# Data Warehouse - FRONTEND
Tool that allows a Marketing company to manage all the contacts of its clients for its campaigns.

## Local requirements to run the application
1. Remember that before starting your experience with the interface, you must first have the backend server running, in other words, have followed the `README` steps located in the` backend` folder of the project.

2. I recommend raising the interface server (frontend) through port 5500, using the Visual Studio Code extension [live-server].

3. If you have completed the steps described in both README (`Data Warehouse - FRONTEND` and` Data Warehouse - BACKEND`) by first performing the backend steps and then the frontend steps, you should be ready to navigate through the contact manager Data Warehouse.

4. Tip: If you want to log out or switch user, just close the navigation window and reload the page in another tab, as the identification is handled by `sessionStorage`.
